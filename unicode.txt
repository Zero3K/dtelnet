version 1.3.9 is the first version that tries to support
Unicode, meaning UTF-8 towards the server,
and UTF-16LE towards Windows API.

Notes:

o This file is in utf8; here is some characters to prove it:

    árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép

    Η ζωή που δεν εξετάζεται δεν αρμόζει σε άνθρωπο

    Ĉ ĉ Ĝ ĝ Ĥ ĥ Ĵ ĵ Ŝ ŝ Ŭ ŭ

    АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯ
    абвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя

    £↓←→↑▒∙░♦≥π─§┼≤└┘≠≠±█┬┤├┴┌┐│

o Characters that don't exist in the used font should be substituted
  whith a 'default' character; often a square box: □

  Sometimes instead of that you get a half-width rectangle
  that might cause troubles. This depends on the other characters in
  the same line. It might have something to do with font-linking or font-fallback.

  Test:
	        ± ⎺ ⎻ ⎼ ⎽ -- plusminus, then four undisplayable char
	      ≠ ± ⎺ ⎻ ⎼ ⎽ -- not-equal, plusminus, then four undisplayable char
			     their width (in some cases) is the half of the expected

o Some Windows versions might not support
  Unicode supplemental characters

  Test: this unicode character '🍔' (U+1F354; UTF-8: f0-9f-8d-94; UTF-16: d83c-df54)
  represents a hamburger

  Even if it is unlikely to be displayed properly,
  it should be displayed as _one_ empty square,
  not as _two_ empty square.

o When connecting a Unix server, there are some environment variables, that should
  be set to indicate UTF-8 mode. Some of those:

    LC_CTYPE=lang_country.UTF-8		# most important
    LESSCHARSET=utf-8			# if you use pager 'less'
    NLS_LANG=lang_country.AL32UTF8	# for Oracle-users

  In an ideal world, the client (dtelnet.exe) could send these to the server (it
  would be the [EnvVars] section in dtelnet.ini or in the session-file). 
  Sadly the tipical telnet-server doesn't accept these variables from the client,
  so you may want to use some .profile-files to set your variables.

  In file 'dtelnet.set' there is a suggestion for those who want handle both 8-bit
  and unicode client-connections: use the new terminal-types 'xterm-utf8-kbs8'
  or 'xterm-utf8-kbs177' (see backspace.txt) for unicode connections, and check
  the value of $TERM in your .profile, eg:

	case "$TERM" in
	*-utf8-*)
	    export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
	    export NLS_LANG=american_america.AL32UTF8
	    export LESSCHARSET=utf-8
	;;
	*)
	    export LC_CTYPE=en_US.ISO-8859-1
	    export NLS_LANG=american_america.WE8ISO8859P1
	    export LESSCHARSET=latin-1
	;;
	esac
